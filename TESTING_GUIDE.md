import { formatDate, formatRelativeTime, validateEmail } from '../utils'

describe('Utils', () => {
  test('formatDate formats dates correctly', () => {
    const date = new Date('2024-01-01')
    expect(formatDate(date)).toBe('January 1, 2024')
  })

  test('validateEmail validates emails correctly', () => {
    expect(validateEmail('test@example.com')).toBe(true)
    expect(validateEmail('invalid-email')).toBe(false)
  })
})
```

### Integration Tests
Test component interactions:

```javascript
// src/components/__tests__/Navigation.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import Navigation from '../Navigation'
import { AuthProvider } from '@/contexts/AuthContext'

describe('Navigation', () => {
  test('shows login link for unauthenticated users', () => {
    render(
      <AuthProvider>
        <Navigation />

test('user can register and login', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('/')
  await page.click('text=Get Started')
  
  // Fill registration form
  await page.fill('[name="fullName"]', 'Test User')
  await page.fill('[name="email"]', 'test@example.com')
  await page.fill('[name="password"]', 'password123')
  await page.fill('[name="confirmPassword"]', 'password123')
  
  await page.click('button[type="submit"]')
  
  // Should redirect to login
  await expect(page).toHaveURL('/auth/login')
